# Implementation Notes

## 1. Story Grid
- **Correct Images:**
	- Each story card displays its associated image or video if available.
	- If the media is missing or fails to load, a fallback placeholder image is shown to maintain a consistent grid appearance.
- **Robust Media Handling:**
	- Supports both images and videos for story media.
	- Handles unsupported or missing media gracefully.

## 2. Badge on Submit
- **Badge Field in Submission:**
	- The story submission form includes a required badge field (e.g., Article, Poems, Stories).
	- The selected badge is saved to the backend along with the story data.
- **Badge Display:**
	- Each story card displays the badge as a colored label, making it easy to identify the type of content at a glance.

## 3. Social Icons in Footer
- **LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram:**
	- The footer includes icons and links for LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram.
- **Placeholders:**
	- Placeholders for X (Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube are included, ready to be updated with real links in the future.
- **Modern UI:**
	- All icons are styled for a modern, accessible look using `react-icons`.

## How It Was Done

- **React Components:**
	- Story grid and cards are built with reusable React components.
	- Conditional rendering ensures correct media display and fallback.
- **Form Handling:**
	- The badge field is integrated into the form state and validated before submission.
	- On submit, the badge is sent to the backend and stored with the story.
- **Backend Integration:**
	- Custom endpoints handle story CRUD and badge persistence.
- **UI/UX:**
	- Social icons in the footer use `react-icons` for consistency and scalability.
	- Placeholders are clearly labeled for future social media expansion.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
